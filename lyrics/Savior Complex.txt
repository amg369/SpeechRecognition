Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car
Windows up
Crocodile tears
Run the tap 'til it's clear

Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the heat
You're gonna drown in your sleep
For sure, wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Call me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel
One in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down

Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours, and I'll show you mine

All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours
