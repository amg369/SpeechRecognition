Playing would you rather
When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested
You're the one who tried to burn it down

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

We have the same face
I laid awake
As someone shoved you up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man
And you're twice as tall

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

Next time I see you you'll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same things

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touch down I'll be waving
