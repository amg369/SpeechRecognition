# SpeechRecognition

This project recognizes speech as a lyric contained or not contained in a Phoebe Bridgers' song, 
and if it is, it specifies what song the lyric is from by parsing through a list of text file lyrics.
Phoebe Bridgers is used here as an example, but with webscrape.py, one could collect lyrics from any number of artists and compare them to speech.
